[pytest]
; Suppress specific deprecation warnings from third-party libraries during tests.
; Explanations:
; - passlib.handlers.argon2: argon2-cffi exposes a deprecated attribute access (argon2.__version__) which is noisy in CI.
; - python-jose: uses datetime.utcnow() which triggers DeprecationWarning on newer Pythons (use timezone-aware datetimes instead).
; These warnings are suppressed here because they originate in upstream dependencies we cannot change.
; TODO: Remove these filters after upstream libraries release fixes or we upgrade to versions that no longer trigger these warnings.
